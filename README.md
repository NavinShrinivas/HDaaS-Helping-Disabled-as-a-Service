<h1>INTRO:</h1>
<p>Service having multiple Sub-Service with the sole aim of helping the disabled with use or electronics and robotics</p>
<p>Domains our projects falls under :
	<ol>
		<li>engineering (using basic physics  and math for one Sub-Service) </li>
		<li>web development (flask , apiâ€™s by google) </li>
		<li>Robotics (not implemented for hackathon) </li>
		<li>electronics (sensors and such not implemented)</li>

<h1>SERVICES AND HOW TO USE EM : </h1>
<h2>Tippoff service </h2>
<p>a person in wheelchair may not realise when a slope may not be safe to use, and sometimes unfortunately they may fall off

<p>
	<ul>
        <li><p>This service is to be used to detect if a slope is safe to climb over </p></li>
        <li><p>service call format : <code>http://locahost:5000/tippoffservice/x/y/typ </code></p></li>
        <li><p>OPTIONS : 
            <ul>
                <li>x : height between flat floor and sensor [can be hard coded]</li>
                <li>y : data recived from sensor of distance between sensor and slope</li>
                <li>type :
                    <ol>
                        <li>wa : without assistance saftey tolerances of ADA standards will be taken into account</li>
                        <li>a : assisted saftey tolerances of ADA standards will be taken into account</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
<h2>TextToBraille</h2>
<p>this converts the text to braille format considering a mechnical solutiion by desing a device with mechnical brailles</p>
<p>service call format : <code>http://localhost:5000/txt-braille/txt </code></p>
<p>This returns a list with each elements of strings of length 6 each charecter either 1 or 0. The index of the number corresponds to a particular posistion on 3X6 Braille matrix</p>

<h1>FUTURE TO ADD SUB-SERIVCES</h1>
<ul>
	<li>TTSService real time text to speech service</li>
</ul>
